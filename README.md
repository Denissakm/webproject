# webproject

This is a basic to-do list application, that works in a browser. You can run it easily by downloading full archive. Inside the folder you will find 3 files:
• Index.html - basic html file
• Javascript file - some lines are commented
• CSS file - creates all visual stuff

Functions are:
• Create, delete, mark as done/favourite tasks
• Tasks are saved into the localstorage, so you can reload the page 
• You can filter tasks as favourite\all tasks
• Task counter

Known bugs:
• Attributes such as "Deleted", "Done", "Favourite" are not stored in the localstorage, so by restarting the page you will lose those attributes
